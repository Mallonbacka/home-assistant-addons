# Backup Cleaner

Remove all but the most recent backup automatically and securely.

Use this alongside offsite backups to keep disk usage low, while having the most recent backup available for quick restore if necessary.

The script is really simple, and accesses only the backups part of the Home Assistant Supervisor API.
